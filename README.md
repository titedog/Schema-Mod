# Schema-Mod
A fabric mod for mcdiamondfire.com which allows developers to enhance their plots.

# Downloading
Check the `releases` tab to find new downloads for the mod. Usually the mod won't update except for new minecraft versions, or if there is a crucial bug.

# Example Plot Script
For an `example` of a  plot script, I have posted a github repository you can find [here](https://github.com/titedog/Schema-Test-Plot-Script/blob/main/Script.txt).
